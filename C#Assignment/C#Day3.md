abstract method doesn't provide an implementation and forces the derived class to override the method.
virtual: can have the implementation and also provides the option for overriding it

Abstract vs classes:
abstract class cannot be instantiated but concrete classes can
as long as one abstract method in class, the class must be abstract
asbtract classes can contain concrete methods as well as abstract methods.

Interface:
By default, has all members be public
interfaces can only have method declaration not implementation
interface can not have constructors, abstract can interfaces cannot have variables
interfaces can still have properties
you cannot make instance of an interface like abstract.
Why we use interface:
Code readability code maintainability. code "semantics".
Loose coupling:
means. interconnecting the components in a system or networks, they have less effection to each other.
