1. What is index; types of indices; pros and cons

```diff
+ One of the best ways to reduce disk I/O(Input/Output) is to use an index
Used to: 
    - Quickly find data in the WHERE clause.
    - Find matching rows in JOIN clause
    - Maintain quniqueness of key columns during INSERT & UPDATE
    - Sort, Aggregate and Group data. 

@@ Clustered Index && Non-Clustered Index @@
! Clustered Index: 
    - a way to represented base data as a whole.
        - Data rows are sorted
        - Data is stored at the leaf level
    - Primary key as default
- CON
    - Can't use filter, bacause it contains the base data in the table.
    - A clustered index creates lots of constant page splits, which includes data page as well as index pages.
- PRO
    - An ideal option for range or group by with MAX, MIN, COUNT type Queries

! Non-Clustered Index: 
    - a physically separate structure that reference the base data and it can have different sorted order.
        - Data rows are not sorted (Because it doesn't change the base data)
        - INCLUDE stored at leaf level
    - Uses Cluster ket or RID of a heap.
- CON
    - Have to use INCLUDE clause to get non-key value
    - Lookup process becomes costly
    - Every time the clustering key is updated, a corresponding update is required on the non-clustered index as it stores the clustering key.

- PRO
    - A table may have multiple non-clustered indexed in RDBMS.

Disadvantage of Index: 
    - Additional Disk Space
    - Insert, Update, Delete Statement become slow 
```

2. What's the difference between Primary key and Unique constraint?
```diff
! Primary Key:
    - Unqiue field on table, can't be null.
    - Other table can use this field to create foreign key relationships to themselves.
    - Create the cluster index automatically.
    - Only 1 primary key in a table.

! Unique Contraint:
    - A particular field must be unique.
    - Allows multiple Unqiue contraint in a table.
```

3. Tell me about check constraint
- Used to Limit the value range that can be placed in a column.
```
--Example:
    CREATE TABLE Persons (
    ID int NOT NULL,
    LastName varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    FirstName varchar(255),
    Age int,
    CHECK (Age>=18));
```

4. Difference between temp table and table variable
Temporary Tables (#tmp) and Table Variables (@tmp)

```diff
! Temporary table
    a database table that exists temporarily on the database server.
    - stores a subset of data from a normal table for a certain period of time.

Used it when you have a large number of records in a table and you repeatedly need to interact with a small subset of those records.

! Table Variable
    a special type of the local variable that helps to store data temporarily. 
    - don't participate in transactions. If you want to ROLLBACK mid way through a procedure then table variables will still be populated.
```

5. Difference between WHERE and HAVING

```diff
! WHERE
is used to filter the records from the table or used while joining more than one table.
    - used with select update
    - used before group by clasue

SELECT S_Name, Age FROM Student 
WHERE Age >=18

! HAVING
is used to filter the records from the groups based on the given condition in the HAVING clause.
    - Have to have group by.
    - can contain aggregate function
    - only used with select
    - used after group by

SELECT Age, COUNT(Roll_No) AS No_of_Students 
FROM Student 
GROUP BY Age
HAVING COUNT(Roll_No) > 1 

```

6. Difference between RANK() and DenseRank() â€” value gap

```diff
! Rank:
    - Ties are assigned the same rank, with the next ranking skipped. (1,2,2,4)

! Dense_Rank:
    - rank within your ordered partition, but ranks are consecutive. (1,2,2,3)
```

7. COUNT(*) vs. COUNT(colName)
```diff
! Count(*)
    - returns all rows whether column contains null value.

! Count(columnName)
    - returns the number of rows except null rows.
```


8. What's the difference between left join and inner join? JOIN and Subquery, which one has a better performance, why?

```diff
! Left join:
    - Returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table, If no matched data from right table, that rows will have NULL values. 

! Inner join:
    - Returns records that have matching values in both tables.

! Join:
    - executes faster. will always faster than subquery
    - Better use database's abilities to search through, filter, sort, etc. Instead of multiple quries using one join query.
-    Disadvantages:
    - not easy to read as subquery
    - incorrect joins can result in serious performance degradation and inaccurate query results.

!Subquery:
    - easy to understand. 
-    Disadvantages: 
    - we cannot modify a table and select from the same table within a subquery in the same SQL statement.

!Conclusion:
A subquery is easier to write, but a joint might be better optimized by the server. For example a Left Outer join typically works faster because servers optimize it.
